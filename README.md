# Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Cyclistic
My final capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

## Ask
First I had to ask questions about what my stakeholders would want and how I was meant to answer the guiding question.

Guiding Question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
Business Task: To find trends that show how annual members and casual riders us Cyclistic differently. Use these trends to give recommendations for the marketing team to turn casual riders into members.
Shareholders: Marketing team and Executive team
